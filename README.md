This theme is currently based on [Type](https://type-jekyll.aspirethemes.com).

I removed everything I could including:

* Slide out panel
* div based grid
* Almost all JS
* Unused CSS

Biggest change/improvement was instituting a CSS based grid (although it isn't super necessary for a single column site).

Feel free to beg/borrow/steal the layout/css, but please do not republish any of the cotent.
