**Howdy! Thanks for stopping by.**

I am a bootstrapped business founder & advocate, ruby on rails developer, husband, father, sometimes basketball coach. I love to build things.

I have worked at startups (we call them small businesses on the east coast)
for nearly 20 years. This site is a collection of what I am working on, learning, and find interesting.

I am [@scottw](https://twitter.com/scottw) on Twitter and can be emailed at [hi@scottw.com](mailto:hi@scottw.com).
