Hello, I am Scott Watermasysk, and I am the most blessed man on the planet.

I live in New Jersey with these three amazing women.

I am the co-founder of a self-funded business, KickoffLabs (we make lead generation via viral contests easy). If you work in marketing, startups, or have a pulse, you needed KickoffLabs yesterday.

* Graduated from Rutgers
* Spend many years in the .NET/ASP.Net world, but now code almost exclusively in Ruby.
* I believe the world would be better if people spent more time doing creative things (*note:* creative is much more than just art).
* I drive to many dance classes.
* I still play basketball when my body (and family ðŸ˜ƒ) allow.
* Software is what I was born to do professionally.

Thanks for stopping by. Please let me know if there is something I can do to help you be more successful.
