My primary activity/responsibility â€“ Raising two wonderful daughters with my amazing wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of KickoffLabs. I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on:

* Improving our fraud protection
* Broadcast emails
* Leads via Phone/SMS
* Just making things easier to use

Outside of Family and KickoffLabs:

* Writing more (I hope!)
* Prototyping a couple of other product ideas
* Experimenting with Serverless programming, playing with CosmoDB, finally starting to make sense of Docker.
