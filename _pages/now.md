My primary activity/responsibility â€“ Raising two wonderful daughters with my amazing wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of KickoffLabs. I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on:

* Improving our fraud protection
* Leads via Phone/SMS
* Improving how we handle and process images
* Experimenting with options to publish pages directly to a CDN
* Just making things easier to use

Outside of Family and KickoffLabs:

* Writing more (I hope!)
* Getting ready to launch [Indie Triage](https://indietriage.com)
* Prototyping a couple of other product ideas
* Trying to get better at visual/web design
* Experimenting with docker
* Less time on twitter and more time on places like:
  * [IndieHackers](https://indiehackers.com)
  * [Discuss Bootstrap](https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/)
