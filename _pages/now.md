My primary activity/responsibility â€“ Raising two great daughters with my fantastic wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of KickoffLabs. I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on:

- Improving our Outbound Webhooks
- Enabling Inbound Webhooks
- Experimenting with some API additions/updates

Outside of Family and KickoffLabs:

- Writing more (I hope!)
- Building [How I VSCode](https://howivscode.com)
- Prototyping a couple of other product ideas (maybe even the successor or evolution of KickoffLabs itself)
- Digging deeper in JavaScript. Especially React, TypeScript, and a little Svelte
- Trying to decide if I love or hate GraphQL
