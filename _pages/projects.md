Here are are the projects I am currently involved in:

[KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com) - I guess a `project` is a stretch since this is also my livelihood. ðŸ˜€ KickoffLabs is a platform for **growing your business with viral marketing contests**. I have been working on it for about seven years (March 2011), and it is still going strong.

[New Jersey Bootstrappers](https://njbootstrappers.com) -  Still in its infancy stage, I am hoping to grow & connect a community around small self-funded business ideas.

[Indie Triage](https://indietriage.com) - Tries to help ensure all questions asked on sites like Indie Hackers get answered.

[Shorti](https://github.com/scottwater/shorti) - Simple API only URL Shortener ([more details](/shorti)).
