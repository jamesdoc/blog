Here are are the projects I am currently involved in:

[KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com) - I guess a `project` is a stretch since this is also my livelihood. ðŸ˜€ KickoffLabs is a platform for **growing your business with viral marketing contests**. I have been working on it for about eight years (March 2011), and it is still going strong.

[New Jersey Bootstrappers](https://njbootstrappers.com) - Still in its infancy stage, I am hoping to grow & connect a community around small self-funded business ideas.

[Indie Triage](https://indietriage.com) - Tries to help ensure all questions asked on sites like Indie Hackers get answered. (_Paused for now. APIs are not solid enough to build on yet_)

[Jekyll Rest](https://github.com/scottwater/jekyll_rest) - An API for Jekyll ([more details](/jekyll-rest)).

[Shorti](https://github.com/scottwater/shorti) - Simple API only URL Shortener ([more details](/shorti)).

[How I VSCode](https://howivscode.com) - A simple way to share how you are using VSCode.
