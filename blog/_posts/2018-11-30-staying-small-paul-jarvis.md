Interesting interview of [Paul Jarvis][1] on [Full Stack Radio][2] this week about the size of a business and knowing when big enough is...well...big enough.

My mind set has always been, "if you are not growing you are shrinking (or maybe failing)". This definitely has given me something to think about.
