This is something I constantly struggle with when it comes to software. 

At this point in my career, I can build just about anything given enough time.  However, it often means I can get in my own way of just getting started.

This blog is a prime example. I have been going back and forth on how to mix quicker short form posts and longer content in my head for years...but once I just embraced the constraints of an existing product, I was able to finally make some progress.
