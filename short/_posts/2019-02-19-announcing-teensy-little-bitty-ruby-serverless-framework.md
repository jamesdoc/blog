I was playing around with FaaStRuby when it dawned on me that everything needed to build my own serverless ruby framework was right in front me (Heroku + Sinatra). 

Then, all I remember seeing is dollar signs and code flying across my terminal. On my second git push to Heroku, [Teensy](https://github.com/scottwater/teensy) was born.

I am only semi-joking. Most of what you would do 'serverless' could easily be accomplished with this code.

If I am really missing the mark on some thing, please let me know @scottw.
