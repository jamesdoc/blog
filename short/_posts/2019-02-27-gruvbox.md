Recently started using the [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme.

I love that it has both a dark and light option. It totes itself on being better at contrast than Solarized and I have to agree (well, at least it feels better looking at it).

For both the dark and light options I felt most comfortable with the `hard` option for contrast. For dark, soft and medium where OK. For light, on hard worked. 

Mixing it in withe Fire Code Retina and everything feels brand new.
