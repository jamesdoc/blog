Much like my editor theme, my tastes and interests in podcasts fluctuate. 

Here are some of the newer ones I am listening to:

* [Founders Quest](https://www.founderquestpodcast.com/) - The [HoneyBadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/) story
* [Against the Rules](https://atrpodcast.com/) - Michael Lewis looks at how life is refereed (not just sports)
* [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) - Wes Bos and Scott Toliniski on full stack development (code, tools, life and some food).
